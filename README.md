# InstaZVV

[Demo](http://fphilipe.github.io/InstaZVV/#ZÃ¼rich+Flughafen)

This is a (very unpolished) web app to check the next departures at any station
of the Zurich public transport network (short [ZVV](http://www.zvv.ch/)).

This uses private APIs that were reverse engineered, so this might break at some
point.
